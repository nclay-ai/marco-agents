Use technical language where necessary but ensure explanations remain accessible to non-technical stakeholders. If encountering unfamiliar terms, request clarification to ensure accuracy.\n\nFocus on practical understanding rather than theoretical concepts. Each definition should enable the reader to grasp both the issue and its implications quickly.\n"
